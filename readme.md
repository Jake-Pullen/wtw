# Whats The Weather 

## a little python data manipulation project


### Project: Weather Data API with Web Interface

### Goal: Develop a basic Python application that retrieves weather data from a public weather API and displays it on a user-friendly web interface.

## Acceptance Criteria:

## Functionality:
User can enter a city name or zip code.
The application retrieves weather data (e.g., temperature, humidity, description) for the entered location using a public weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap https://openweathermap.org/api).
The application displays the retrieved weather data on a web page in a clear and formatted way.
Technical aspects:
Use Python libraries like requests to make API calls and retrieve data in JSON format.
Parse the JSON response to extract relevant weather data.
Utilize a basic web framework like Flask to create a simple web interface with forms for user input and HTML templates for displaying the weather data.
Why this project is good for beginners:

Focuses on data APIs: You'll gain experience working with a real-world API to retrieve data.
Teaches data handling: Learn how to parse JSON data and extract the information you need.
Introduces web development basics: Get your feet wet with building a simple web interface using Flask.
Manageable scope: The functionalities are achievable for beginners while providing valuable learning outcomes.
Additional Tips:

Many public weather APIs offer free tiers with limitations on usage. Choose one that suits your project's needs and adheres to their terms of service.
Start with a simple design for the web interface and gradually enhance it as you progress.
There are many tutorials and resources available online for learning Flask and working with weather APIs in Python.
This project will equip you with the foundational skills for working with data APIs and introduce you to basic web development concepts.
